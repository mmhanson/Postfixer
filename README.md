# Postfixer
Translates math expressions from infix to postfix notation using syntax-
directed translation. Written in C11.

I decided made this as I learn more about compilers. The [dragon book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) uses a 
infix-to-postfix translator as a way to immediately implement some of the
theory under parsing, so I figured I'd do one as well to learn the theory and practice
my C.
